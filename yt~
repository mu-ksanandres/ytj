# Requires: cclive, wget, mplayer

# Write the yt script to download and play a YouTube video URL.
# (Hopefully, YouTube hasn't changed anything recently.) The cclive
# command should be capable of downloading YouTube videos by URL. The
# mplayer command should be capable of playing the YouTube video
# formats.

# Script's first argument, $1 (youtube URL) must be surrounded with ' ' or " ".

# cclive doesn't preserve video title well when creating video file, so
# will use following wget pipeline to extract video file title from
# youtube video page. Video file title will have spaces replaced with
# "_". If video title is "Pomplamoose - Another Day", then downloaded
# video file will be "Pomplamoose_-_Another_Day.webm".

title=$(wget $1 --quiet -O - | grep '<title>' |
        sed "s/^.*<title>//" | sed "s/<\/title.*$//" | sed "s/ - YouTube//" |
        tr " " "_" | sed "s/[^A-Za-z0-9_@-\.]//g")

filetitle=$title.webm

# Put quiet cclive in the background w/ &:
cclive -q -O $filetitle $1 &



## For use with ytj, yt should just download, not play
## sleep 5    # Allow 5 seconds for video file ($filetitle) to be created by cclive
## 
## mplayer $filetitle
## 
## rm $filetitle # Clean up
